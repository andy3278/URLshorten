Introduction

In this project, you'll learn how to build a website that shortens URLs. Optimizing the length of your website's URLs is useful on space-sensitive forums, helps websites rank better in search results, and are also easier for users to type out.

Your UI should include the following elements:

Text input for the user's URL

"Shorten" button to trigger the link shortening
